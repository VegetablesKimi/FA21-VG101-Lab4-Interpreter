# FA21-VG101-Lab4-Interpreter
This is the lab4 in 2021 Fall semester in VG101 (Intro to Computers &amp; Programming) for students in UM-SJTU JI which is about a simple matlab interpreter.
# Background and object
An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language. For example, matlab is executed through an interpreter.
Comparing with compiler, which turns a program into an executable binary file(for example, .exe on windows), interpreter does not generate binary file directly.

Generally speaking, Compiling principle is an advanced CS course for undergraduate students. In this lab, we only require you to implement a very simple matlab interpreter, which can calculate the value of expressions, store variables and print out formatted output similar to fprintf in
matlab.

Your object is to read commands from a txt file, and you need to parse these commands and output the results line by line.
